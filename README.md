Summary - 
This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb datasets from Los Angeles and New York City. The primary objectives are to evaluate price trends, identify key factors influencing pricing, examine the differences in pricing patterns between these two major cities, and explore the elements that contribute to achieving super-host status. Additionally, we will investigate the variations in room types across the regions, offering a comprehensive comparison of the Airbnb markets in both cities. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover valuable insights for hosts and travelers alike. Understanding pricing trends and host performance metrics will facilitate data-driven decision-making regarding Airbnb listings.

The project aims to analyze the Airbnb datasets of Los Angeles and New York City to assess pricing patterns, the influencing factors of superhosts, and the differences in Airbnb types across regions. We will:

Identify the influencing factors of superhosts in both cities and compare the results to evaluate their commonalities and differences.
Identify the most important factors affecting Airbnb prices in both cities and compare the results to evaluate their commonalities and differences.
Examine the distribution of room types across regions, compare them, and identify the differences between the two cities.
Visualize the distribution of mutiple types and provide a visual representation of the supervised learning models.
Motivation

Airbnb significantly impacts the U.S. house renting and tourism industry. To stay competitive, understanding the factors behind super host success and room price differences is essential. This project aims to uncover these insights, enabling Airbnb to better target potential super hosts, refine its location-based offerings, and help new users make informed decisions, ultimately improving the platformâ€™s strategic planning and user satisfaction.
